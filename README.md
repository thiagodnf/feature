# Feature Models for SBSE

A repository responsible for saving the feature models used in the experiments in SBSE (Search-based Software Engineering).

## Available Feature models
This project currently contains the following feature models:

- Drupal 7.23

## How to visualize them

To open the models, you need to install the FeatureIDE plugin for Eclipse. To do that:

1. Open the Eclipse Marketplace from About menu
2. Search for "FeatureIDE" and install it. Restart the eclipse

The plugin was tested with Eclipse Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a) and FeatureIDE 3.5. Later versions should be tested. Once you installed the plugin, you have to import the project going to:

```
File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
```

The feature models are inside the source (src) folder. You can visualize or modify them. To visualize the features models in a different extension, access the exported folder.
